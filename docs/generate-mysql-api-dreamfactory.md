To create an API with MySQL in DreamFactory, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your DreamFactory instance.

2. Navigate to the "Services" tab in the left sidebar.

3. Click on the "Create" button to add a new service.

4. Select "MySQL" from the list of available service types.

5. Fill in the service details:
   - Name: Give your service a unique name (e.g., "mysql_api")
   - Label: Provide a human-readable label (e.g., "MySQL API")
   - Description: (Optional) Add a brief description of your service

6. Configure the MySQL connection:
   - Host: Enter the hostname or IP address of your MySQL server
   - Port: Specify the port number (default is 3306)
   - Database: Enter the name of the database you want to connect to
   - Username: Provide the MySQL user with appropriate permissions
   - Password: Enter the password for the MySQL user
   - Schema: (Optional) Specify a schema if needed

7. Click on the "Test Connection" button to ensure DreamFactory can connect to your MySQL database.

8. If the connection is successful, click "Save" to create the service.

9. DreamFactory will automatically generate a REST API for your MySQL database, including endpoints for tables, views, and stored procedures.

10. To secure your API, go to the "Roles" tab and create a new role or modify an existing one to include the necessary permissions for your MySQL service.

11. Generate an API key for the role you've created or modified.

12. Your MySQL API is now ready to use. You can access it using the generated API key and the following base URL:

    `http://your-dreamfactory-instance/api/v2/mysql_api`

Replace "mysql_api" with the name you gave your service in step 5.

You can now perform CRUD operations on your MySQL database using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and the appropriate endpoints generated by DreamFactory.
