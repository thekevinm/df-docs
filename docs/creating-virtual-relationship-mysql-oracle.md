  # Creating a Virtual Relationship Between MySQL and Oracle

To create a virtual relationship between MySQL and Oracle databases using DreamFactory, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your DreamFactory instance.

2. Navigate to the "Services" tab in the admin console.

3. Create two separate database services:
   - One for MySQL
   - One for Oracle

4. Once both services are created, go to the "Schema" tab for each service and ensure the tables you want to relate are visible.

5. Create a new API V8 service:
   - Name it appropriately (e.g., "MySQL_Oracle_Relation")
   - Choose "Virtual" as the service type

6. In the new Virtual service, go to the "Resources" tab.

7. Click on "Create" to add a new virtual relationship:
   - Select the MySQL service and table as the parent
   - Select the Oracle service and table as the child
   - Define the relationship type (e.g., belongs_to, has_many)
   - Specify the fields to join on for both parent and child tables

8. Save the virtual relationship configuration.

9. Test the relationship by making API calls to the virtual service endpoint.

Example API call:

GET /api/v2/MySQL_Oracle_Relation/_table/mysql_table?related=oracle_table

This call will return data from the MySQL table along with related data from the Oracle table based on the virtual relationship you defined.

Remember to set up appropriate roles and permissions for accessing this virtual service.
